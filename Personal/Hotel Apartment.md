Rent would be around 6k per month 

pros:
1. rent will start from 23rd april. we will be able to save rent money from 1st april to 23rd april
2. we will have little budget left in our pocket. we will be having minimum 40k AED in my account on 23rd april. Out of which, some money we will use for marriage. As per calculation, we will be needing 3 lakh for me and 1 lakh for you.
3. We can move to any other place, wherever you will get job.

cons:
1. that will not be our home.
2. we again need to setup everything after few months.
3. it's just like we will be living in a hotel for few months but it will have kitchen to cook.
4. You might not feel comfortable in studying, which is mandatory for you to look for new job.
