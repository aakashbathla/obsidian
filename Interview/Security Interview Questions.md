1. **What is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?**
   - XSS is a security vulnerability where attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can hijack user sessions, steal sensitive information, or perform actions on behalf of the user.

2. **How can you prevent XSS attacks?**
   - Use proper input validation and output encoding. Sanitize user input to strip out potentially dangerous characters and encode output to prevent execution of scripts.

3. **What is Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)?**
   - CORS is a security feature implemented by browsers to restrict cross-origin HTTP requests. It prevents a web page from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the original web page.

4. **Why is Content Security Policy (CSP) important?**
   - CSP is a security feature that helps mitigate XSS attacks by specifying which content sources are allowed to be loaded on a web page. It helps prevent execution of unauthorized scripts and resources.

5. **What is Clickjacking?**
   - Clickjacking is a technique where attackers trick users into clicking on something different from what they perceive, often by overlaying transparent elements on top of legitimate clickable elements.

6. **How can you protect against Clickjacking?**
   - Use X-Frame-Options HTTP header to prevent your web pages from being embedded in frames on other sites. Additionally, you can use the `frame-ancestors` directive in CSP to control which domains can embed your site in frames.

7. **What is SQL Injection?**
   - SQL Injection is a type of attack where attackers inject malicious SQL queries into input fields of a web application, exploiting vulnerabilities in the backend database.

8. **How can you prevent SQL Injection?**
   - Use prepared statements and parameterized queries to sanitize input data and prevent direct concatenation of user input with SQL queries. Also, limit database permissions for application accounts to minimize potential damage.

9. **What is Content Sniffing (MIME sniffing)?**
   - Content Sniffing is a browser feature where it attempts to determine the content type of a resource based on its content rather than the content type specified in the HTTP headers. It can lead to security vulnerabilities if browsers incorrectly interpret the content type.

10. **How can you prevent Content Sniffing vulnerabilities?**
    - Set the `X-Content-Type-Options` HTTP header to `nosniff` to instruct browsers not to perform MIME sniffing and instead rely on the provided content type in the HTTP headers. Additionally, always explicitly set the content type in HTTP headers to avoid ambiguity.

Certainly! Here are 10 more frontend security questions:

11. **What is Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and how can it be prevented?**
    - CSRF is an attack where a malicious website tricks a user's browser into making unauthorized requests to a different website where the user is authenticated. To prevent CSRF, use techniques like CSRF tokens, same-site cookies, and checking the Origin header.

12. **What are the risks associated with using third-party libraries in frontend development?**
    - Third-party libraries may contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. Risks include outdated dependencies, malicious code injection, and compromised CDN sources. Regularly update dependencies, use integrity checks for CDN resources, and audit code for vulnerabilities.

13. **What is the purpose of HTTPS and why is it important for frontend security?**
    - HTTPS encrypts communication between a user's browser and the web server, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity. It protects against eavesdropping, data tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks, enhancing overall frontend security.

14. **What are the best practices for securely storing sensitive data on the client-side?**
    - Avoid storing sensitive data in client-side storage like cookies or local storage. If necessary, encrypt sensitive data before storing it, and use secure methods for transmitting data between the client and server.

15. **What is the Same-Origin Policy (SOP) and how does it contribute to frontend security?**
    - SOP is a security feature that restricts how a document or script loaded from one origin interacts with resources from another origin. It prevents malicious scripts from accessing sensitive data or performing unauthorized actions across different origins.

16. **What are the security implications of using inline styles and scripts in web development?**
    - Inline styles and scripts can increase the risk of XSS attacks since they allow injection of executable code directly into HTML documents. Avoid inline styles/scripts whenever possible and use external files with proper encoding and sanitization.

17. **How can you mitigate security risks associated with client-side caching?**
    - Implement cache control headers to control caching behavior, especially for sensitive or frequently changing resources. Use cache busting techniques to ensure that updated resources are always retrieved from the server.

18. **What is the role of security headers in frontend security?**
    - Security headers provide additional protection against various attacks by controlling browser behavior and enforcing security policies. Examples include Content-Security-Policy (CSP), X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, and HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).

19. **What is the difference between authentication and authorization in frontend security?**
    - Authentication verifies the identity of users, ensuring they are who they claim to be. Authorization determines what actions and resources users are allowed to access based on their authenticated identity.

20. **Why is it important to conduct security audits and penetration testing on frontend applications?**
    - Security audits and penetration testing help identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in frontend applications before they are exploited by attackers. Regular testing ensures that security measures are effective and up-to-date.

21. **What is the role of Input Validation in frontend security?**
    - Input validation ensures that data entered by users meets specified criteria, such as format, length, and range. Proper input validation helps prevent various security vulnerabilities, including XSS, SQL injection, and buffer overflows.

22. **How can you prevent sensitive information exposure in frontend applications?**
    - Avoid exposing sensitive information, such as error messages, stack traces, or internal server details, to users in production environments. Implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms to handle errors without revealing sensitive data.

23. **What are the security considerations when using third-party APIs in frontend development?**
    - When integrating third-party APIs, ensure they are properly authenticated, authorized, and encrypted to protect sensitive data transmission. Regularly review API documentation and update integration methods to incorporate security best practices.

24. **What is the role of Secure Cookies in frontend security?**
    - Secure cookies are HTTP cookies transmitted over HTTPS only, providing additional protection against eavesdropping and interception by encrypting cookie data. Use secure cookies for session management and sensitive data storage in web applications.

25. **How can you protect against DOM-based XSS attacks?**
    - DOM-based XSS attacks occur when client-side scripts manipulate the DOM to execute malicious code. To prevent DOM-based XSS, sanitize user inputs, validate data before DOM manipulation, and use security libraries like DOMPurify.

26. **What are the security implications of using client-side frameworks and libraries?**
    - Client-side frameworks and libraries may introduce security vulnerabilities, such as outdated dependencies, insecure configurations, or improper usage. Stay informed about security updates, follow best practices recommended by framework developers, and conduct security assessments regularly.

27. **What is the role of Security by Design in frontend development?**
    - Security by Design emphasizes integrating security considerations into the entire software development lifecycle, including requirements, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance phases. It promotes proactive identification and mitigation of security risks from the outset.

28. **What are the common security threats targeting Single Page Applications (SPAs)?**
    - Common security threats to SPAs include XSS, CSRF, insecure authentication mechanisms, improper data validation, and unauthorized access to client-side resources. Implement security controls tailored to SPA architectures to mitigate these threats effectively.

29. **What are the security implications of using client-side storage mechanisms like localStorage and sessionStorage?**
    - Client-side storage mechanisms like localStorage and sessionStorage store data locally in the browser, making them susceptible to XSS attacks and data leakage. Minimize the use of client-side storage for sensitive data and implement encryption and access controls where necessary.

30. **How can you prevent Man-in-the-Browser (MitB) attacks in frontend applications?**
    - MitB attacks occur when attackers intercept and modify communication between the user's browser and the server, often by injecting malicious scripts into web pages. To prevent MitB attacks, use HTTPS, implement strong authentication mechanisms, and regularly monitor for suspicious activities.
